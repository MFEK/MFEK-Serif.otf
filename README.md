Besly*
=====

Besly* is based off of the work of Robert Besly. This font is still basically in the conception phase. The game plan is to build the font from scratch using the designs of Besly as inspiration for the regular version, and using the designs of Bodoni to inform the italic version. I would also like to differ from digital versions of Besly's Clarendon in that I would prefer to have hard serif lines and not curve into them. If you are a type designer and feel like helping to make this possible please reach out, either via GitHub or [Email](indestructibletype@gmail.com).
