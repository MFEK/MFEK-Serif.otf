Besley* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by 
the designs of Robert Besley. This is version 1.1.

Besley* is designed and maintained by [Owen Earl](https://plus.google.com/103790404905174393616), who is the creator of the font foundry [indestructible type*](http://indestructible-type.github.io).

About
-----
The design process of Besley* started with looking at what works with 
Clarendon and maintaining those assets, while expanding design and 
functionality. In order to maintain a sturdy and heavy weighting, while adding 
text-size readability, wide capitals are used alongside appropriately widthed 
lowercase letters. To make Besley* render well on screens, a larger x-height 
was chosen. The medium weight of Besley* is bolder than typical fonts of the 
digital era, to give that cowboy era weight. Italics were built into the 
design process, so they feel like part of the family, instead of an 
after-thought. 

Changelog
---------

Building
--------
Besley* was created using the free and open source font building application [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/).
To build it yourself you are going to need to download a copy of FontForge,
which you can get from their [website](https://fontforge.github.io/), or can be build using the [github branch](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/blob/master/INSTALL-git.md).

In FontForge, unlink all references by selecting all (Ctrl-A) and pressing Ctrl-U.
Then remove all overlap by pressing Ctrl-Shift-O. Simplify, using Ctrl-Shift-M,
then round to nearist int by pressing Ctrl-Shift-_. Ctrl-Shift-G to generate
your font!
