========
![Besley* Picture](https://indestructibletype.com/assets/Besley.svg)
Besley* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by 
the designs of Robert Besley. This is version 2.0.

Besley* is designed and maintained by [Owen Earl](https://plus.google.com/103790404905174393616), who is the creator of the font foundry [indestructible type*](http://indestructible-type.github.io).

About
-----
The design process of Besley* started with looking at what works with 
Clarendon and maintaining those assets, while expanding design and 
functionality. In order to maintain a sturdy and heavy weighting, while adding 
text-size readability, wide capitals are used alongside appropriately widthed 
lowercase letters. To make Besley* render well on screens, a larger x-height 
was chosen. The medium weight of Besley* is bolder than typical fonts of the 
digital era, to give that cowboy era weight. Italics were built into the 
design process, so they feel like part of the family, instead of an 
after-thought.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you particularly want to build fonts manually on your own computer, you will need to install the [`yq` utility](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). On OS X with Homebrew, type `brew install yq`; on Linux, try `snap install yq`; if all else fails, try the instructions on the linked page.

Then:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.
